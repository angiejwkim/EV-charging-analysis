# Palo Alto Electric Vehicle Charging Analysis

This project was completed by Angie Kim, Julia Gilman, and Sarah Conlisk as a final project for ECON 1660: Big Data at Brown University. Modelling car arrivals to city-owned charging stations as Poisson process, we estimate the effects of the city government adding new charging stations, using station usage to understand demand. We also explore how imposing limits on charging time improves the efficiency of station use.
