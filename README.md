# Palo Alto Electric Vehicle Charging Analysis

This project was completed by Angie Kim, Julia Gilman, and Sarah Conlisk as a final project for ECON 1660: Big Data at Brown University. Modelling car arrivals to city-owned charging stations as a Poisson process, we estimate the effects of the city government adding new charging stations. We also explore how imposing limits on charging time improves the efficiency of station use.
